# Decision Tree Classifier
This Python script implements a Decision Tree Classifier using the scikit-learn library. A decision tree is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. This code helps to classify data based on the features and labels provided.

Features
Easy to use: This script makes it easy to train a decision tree model on any dataset.
Customizable: The parameters of the decision tree (like max depth, criterion, etc.) can be easily configured.
Visualization: The decision tree structure can be visualized using the plot_tree function.

How it works
Loading the Data: The script reads data from a CSV file. The features (input) and labels (target) are extracted from the dataset.
Preprocessing: The dataset may require some preprocessing like handling missing values or encoding categorical data.
Splitting the Dataset: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Training the Model: The decision tree model is trained using the training set. The user can specify parameters like the maximum depth of the tree, the criterion (gini or entropy), and other hyperparameters.
Making Predictions: After training, the model is used to make predictions on the test set.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Tree Visualization: The tree structure can be visualized using plot_tree, which helps to understand the decisions made by the model at each node.

Visualization
To visualize the decision tree, the code uses plot_tree from matplotlib. This gives a graphical representation of the tree, showing the conditions for splits at each node and the class labels at the leaves.
